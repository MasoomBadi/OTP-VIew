## How to integrate into your app?
Integrating the project is simple. All you need to do is follow the below steps

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file. Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```java
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
  }
}
```
Step 2. Add the dependency
```java
dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.MasoomBadi:OTP-VIew:1.0'
}
```

That's pretty much it and your all wrapped up.
